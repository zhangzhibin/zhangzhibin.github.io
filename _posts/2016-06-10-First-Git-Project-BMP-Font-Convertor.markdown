I was quite lazy I guess. For years, I got a lot help from GitHub and StackOverFlow, but never contribute to them. 

Recently, I made a decision to share some of my working experience. 

Here is the first project: [BMP Font Convertor for Unity](https://github.com/zhangzhibin/UnityTools/tree/master/BMPFontConvertor). It helps converting [BMP font](http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/) to Unity custom font so you can use it directly.

Here you go, feel free to try:
