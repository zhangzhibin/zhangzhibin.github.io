Hi, I assume you wanted to know who I am since you are here :D
  
For now, I am a mobile game developer based in Xiamen, Fujian, China. And, I am also development lead of a small team of Xiaoyao Studio in [Feiyu.com](http://feiyu.com/). 

I started my career as a middleware developer in [TIBCO](http://tibco.com) CDC (China Develop Center) in Nov 2006. And then joined the technique support team Sept 2009. 

I worked on several cool products during my time in TIBCO CDC. I did really enjoy the time working there with those passionate, creative and friendly people.

In 2013, after working in TIBCO CDC for 6 and half years, I made a decision to change. 

I was always dreaming of making games ever since I was a child. Together with two of my college mates, we started a studio  chasing our dream in June 2013 and hoping to make some money.

Lack of experience and financial support, after several months, our first project failed and our team felt apart. 

Then, I moved back to my hometown Fujian from Beijing, with my wife who is always having my back up.

2014, I joined a local Game develop company Feiyu.com. 

I started with Cocos2D-iPhone, a mobile game engine. And then move to Cocos2D-x, which is more supportive in targeting multiple platforms.

After some painful experience with Cocos2D-x in some real projects, I decided to try Unity and finally find my true love :D

In my opinion of view, Unity is much more muture than Cocos2D. It is a really wise choise if you want to focus on making a game instead of improving your debuging and programming techniques.

I am mainly focusing on casual, small sized mobile games.

So far so good.
